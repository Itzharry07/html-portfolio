<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! I’m Harish, a first-year student diving into the exciting world of web development. From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by how websites come to life and the stories they tell.

  As I embark on my journey in coding and design, I’m eager to explore the intersection of creativity and technology. I love taking on challenges, whether it's building a sleek user interface or solving complex programming puzzles.
  
  In my free time, you can find me experimenting with new frameworks, participating in hackathons, or just browsing the web for inspiration. I’m always on the lookout for innovative projects that push boundaries and create meaningful user experiences.
  
  I’m excited to connect with like-minded individuals and collaborate on projects that inspire! Let’s create something amazing together!</p>
